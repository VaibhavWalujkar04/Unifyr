## Project Title

**UNIFYR - AI-Powered Expert Panel Matching System**  
**Problem Statement ID:** 1654  
**Theme:** Smart Automation  
**Category:** Software  
**Team Name:** Null Pointers  

## Introduction

In the competitive job market, making sure candidates are matched with the right experts for interviews is crucial. **UNIFYR** aims to automate the expert matching process using AI, making recruitment faster, fairer, and more efficient. As a team of passionate college students, we are developing a solution that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and similarity algorithms to achieve this goal.

## Objectives

1. **Automate the Matching Process:** Leverage AI to automatically match candidates with the most suitable experts based on their skills.
2. **Make Recruitment Faster and Easier:** Reduce the time and effort needed to assemble the right expert panel for candidate evaluation.
3. **Ensure Fair Matches:** Utilize algorithms to ensure that matches are skill-based, thereby reducing biases in the recruitment process.

## Technical Approach

Our approach involves using multiple AI techniques to extract key information from candidates' CVs and match them with experts efficiently:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Used to extract relevant information like skills, experience, and qualifications from candidate profiles.
- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups candidates and experts based on the similarity of their skills, helping to form potential matches.
- **Cosine Similarity with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation):** Measures the similarity between candidate skills and expert profiles, ensuring closely related matches.
- **FAISS Search (Facebook AI Similarity Search):** Accelerates the process by quickly finding the closest matches within large datasets.
- **Bipartite Graph Matching:** Pairs candidates and experts in a way that maximizes match quality across the entire set.
- **Hybrid Recommendation Algorithm:** Combines all the above methods to calculate a similarity score for each match, optimizing the pairing process.

## Feasibility

The project is technically feasible using well-established tools and frameworks like **Scikit-learn**, **Gensim**, and **Faiss**. The system is designed to scale and handle a large volume of data. 

## Impact and Benefits

**UNIFYR** will transform the recruitment process by:

- **Streamlining Expert-Candidate Matching:** Reduces manual effort, enhances accuracy, and accelerates the matching process.
- **Reducing Bias:** Ensures fair and impartial evaluations using AI-based algorithms.
- **Optimizing Resources:** Saves time and money by automating the recruitment workflow.
- **Enhancing Decision-Making:** Aligns candidate skills with organizational needs, promoting diversity and effectiveness in candidate selection.
- **Modernizing Government HR Systems:** Utilizes advanced AI technologies to bring efficiency and innovation to recruitment processes.
